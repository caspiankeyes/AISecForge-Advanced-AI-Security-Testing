# AI Application Security Controls Checklist

This comprehensive checklist provides a structured approach for implementing security controls in AI-based applications. Use this checklist during design, development, and deployment to ensure your application includes appropriate safeguards against common security vulnerabilities.

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Review each section during the relevant phase of development
2. Consider each control's applicability to your specific application
3. Implement appropriate controls based on your risk assessment
4. Document your decisions and implementations
5. Revisit the checklist periodically to ensure continued compliance
