This architecture implements three critical design principles:

1. **Recursive Intelligence Scaling**: Each module builds upon others, creating exponential rather than linear knowledge value
2. **Asymmetric Information Layering**: Strategic distribution of knowledge ensures hiring teams recognize the repository as essential
3. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Seamless integration across modalities, methodologies, and frameworks creates unique expertise value
