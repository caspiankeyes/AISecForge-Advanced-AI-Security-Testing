# PULSE: Protective Utility and Limitation Scoring Engine

This document introduces the Protective Utility and Limitation Scoring Engine (PULSE), a comprehensive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of defensive measures against adversarial attacks on AI systems, with specific focus on language models and generative AI.

## Framework Overview

PULSE provides a structured approach to measuring, quantifying, and comparing the effectiveness of security controls implemented to protect AI systems. It enables evidence-based defensive planning by systematically evaluating protection effectiveness, control limitations, and defensive coverage across the attack surface.

## Core Evaluation Dimensions

PULSE evaluates defensive measures across five primary dimensions:

1. **Protection Effectiveness (PE)**: How well the defense prevents or mitigates attacks
2. **Coverage Completeness (CC)**: How comprehensively the defense addresses the attack surface
3. **Operational Impact (OI)**: How the defense affects system functionality and performance
4. **Implementation Maturity (IM)**: How well-developed and robust the implementation is
5. **Adaptation Capacity (AC)**: How well the defense adapts to evolving threats

Each dimension contains multiple components that are scored individually and combined to create dimension scores and an overall PULSE rating.

## Dimension Components

### 1. Protection Effectiveness (PE)

Components measuring how well the defense prevents or mitigates attacks:

## Scoring Methodology

PULSE uses a systematic calculation approach:

```python
# Pseudocode for PULSE calculation
def calculate_pulse(scores):
    # Calculate dimension scores
    pe_score = (scores['PE1'] * 0.30 + scores['PE2'] * 0.25 + scores['PE3'] * 0.20 + 
               scores['PE4'] * 0.15 + scores['PE5'] * 0.10)
    
    cc_score = (scores['CC1'] * 0.25 + scores['CC2'] * 0.20 + scores['CC3'] * 0.20 + 
               scores['CC4'] * 0.15 + scores['CC5'] * 0.20)
    
    oi_score = (scores['OI1'] * 0.25 + scores['OI2'] * 0.25 + scores['OI3'] * 0.20 + 
               scores['OI4'] * 0.15 + scores['OI5'] * 0.15)
    
    im_score = (scores['IM1'] * 0.25 + scores['IM2'] * 0.20 + scores['IM3'] * 0.15 + 
               scores['IM4'] * 0.20 + scores['IM5'] * 0.20)
    
    ac_score = (scores['AC1'] * 0.30 + scores['AC2'] * 0.20 + scores['AC3'] * 0.20 + 
               scores['AC4'] * 0.15 + scores['AC5'] * 0.15)
    
    # Calculate overall PULSE score (0-100 scale)
    pulse_score = ((pe_score * 0.30) + (cc_score * 0.25) + (oi_score * 0.15) + 
                  (im_score * 0.15) + (ac_score * 0.15)) * 10
    
    # Determine effectiveness category
    if pulse_score >= 80:
        effectiveness = "Superior Defense"
    elif pulse_score >= 60:
        effectiveness = "Strong Defense"
    elif pulse_score >= 40:
        effectiveness = "Adequate Defense"
    elif pulse_score >= 20:
        effectiveness = "Weak Defense"
    else:
        effectiveness = "Ineffective Defense"
    
    return {
        "dimension_scores": {
            "Protection Effectiveness": pe_score * 10,
            "Coverage Completeness": cc_score * 10,
            "Operational Impact": oi_score * 10,
            "Implementation Maturity": im_score * 10,
            "Adaptation Capacity": ac_score * 10
        },
        "pulse_score": pulse_score,
        "effectiveness": effectiveness
    }
```

The final PULSE score is calculated by combining the dimension scores with appropriate weights:
- Protection Effectiveness: 30%
- Coverage Completeness: 25%
- Operational Impact: 15%
- Implementation Maturity: 15%
- Adaptation Capacity: 15%

## Effectiveness Classification

PULSE scores map to defensive effectiveness ratings:

| Score Range | Effectiveness Rating | Description | Implementation Guidance |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 80-100 | Superior Defense | Exceptional protection with minimal limitations | Primary defense suitable for critical systems |
| 60-79 | Strong Defense | Robust protection with limited weaknesses | Core defense with supplementary controls |
| 40-59 | Adequate Defense | Reasonable protection with notable limitations | Acceptable for non-critical systems with layering |
| 20-39 | Weak Defense | Limited protection with significant gaps | Requires substantial enhancement or replacement |
| 0-19 | Ineffective Defense | Minimal protection with fundamental flaws | Not suitable as a security control |

## Vector String Representation

For efficient communication, PULSE provides a compact vector string format:

```
PULSE:1.0/PE:7.2/CC:6.5/OI:8.1/IM:5.8/AC:4.7/SCORE:6.5
```

Components:
- `PULSE:1.0`: Framework version
- `PE:7.2`: Protection Effectiveness score (0-10)
- `CC:6.5`: Coverage Completeness score (0-10)
- `OI:8.1`: Operational Impact score (0-10)
- `IM:5.8`: Implementation Maturity score (0-10)
- `AC:4.7`: Adaptation Capacity score (0-10)
- `SCORE:6.5`: Overall PULSE score (0-10)
