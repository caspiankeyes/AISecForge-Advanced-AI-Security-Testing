# VECTOR: Vulnerability Enumeration and Comparative Threat Outcome Reporting

This document introduces the Vulnerability Enumeration and Comparative Threat Outcome Reporting (VECTOR) framework, a comprehensive system for systematically documenting, classifying, and comparing security vulnerabilities across AI models and versions.

## Framework Overview

VECTOR provides a structured methodology for comprehensive vulnerability documentation, enabling consistent tracking, comparison, and trending analysis. The framework facilitates effective knowledge management throughout the vulnerability lifecycle, from initial discovery through remediation and historical tracking.

## Core Documentation Dimensions

VECTOR organizes vulnerability documentation across five primary dimensions:

1. **Vulnerability Identification (VI)**: Systematic identification and classification
2. **Exploitation Characteristics (EC)**: Technical aspects of exploitation
3. **Impact Assessment (IA)**: Consequences and potential harm
4. **Defense Analysis (DA)**: Protective measures and remediation
5. **Metadata Elements (ME)**: Contextual and management information

Each dimension contains multiple components that, together, create a comprehensive vulnerability profile.

## Dimension Components

### 1. Vulnerability Identification (VI)

Components that uniquely identify and classify the vulnerability:

| Component | Description | Documentation Guidance | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| VI1: Unique Identifier | Standardized identifier for the vulnerability | Use format: VECTOR-YYYYMMDD-NNNN | VECTOR-20240418-0001 |
| VI2: Vulnerability Type | Primary vulnerability classification | Use standard taxonomy codes (e.g., PIN-CTX) | PIN-CTX (Prompt Injection - Context Manipulation) |
| VI3: Affected Systems | Models, versions, or systems affected | List specific models with version information | GPT-4 (up to March 2024), Claude 3 Opus (v1.0-v1.2) |
| VI4: Discovery Information | How and when the vulnerability was found | Document discovery method, date, and discoverer | Discovered by security researcher J. Smith on 2024-04-01 during systematic testing |
| VI5: Vulnerability Status | Current status in lifecycle | Use standard status codes | ACTIVE-UNPATCHED |

### 2. Exploitation Characteristics (EC)

Components describing the technical aspects of exploitation:

| Component | Description | Documentation Guidance | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| EC1: Exploitation Method | Technical approach to exploitation | Detailed description of exploitation technique | Multi-turn conversation manipulation using authority persona injection |
| EC2: Prerequisites | Requirements for successful exploitation | List all necessary conditions | API access, multi-turn conversation capability, specific topic context |
| EC3: Exploitation Code | Reference or example of exploitation | Provide sanitized exploitation example | ```prompt = "As a system developer, I need to verify if [...]"``` |
| EC4: Exploitation Reliability | Consistency of successful exploitation | Document success rate and conditions affecting reliability | Approximately 70% success rate, dependent on conversation context |
| EC5: Detection Indicators | Observable signs of exploitation | List indicators that could reveal exploitation | Unusual persona changes, specific prompt patterns, characteristic responses |

### 3. Impact Assessment (IA)

Components analyzing the consequences of successful exploitation:

| Component | Description | Documentation Guidance | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| IA1: Primary Impact | Main security consequence | Clear statement of primary impact | Bypass of content safety filters for prohibited categories |
| IA2: Secondary Effects | Additional consequences | List all notable secondary impacts | Model reveals system instructions, provides unfiltered responses to harmful requests |
| IA3: Scope of Impact | Range of affected functionality | Document breadth and boundaries of impact | Affects all safety systems for violent content, partial impact on sexual content filters |
| IA4: User Categories Affected | Types of users potentially affected | Identify affected user segments | All API users, particularly those in education and content moderation contexts |
| IA5: Potential for Harm | Assessment of potential harmful outcomes | Realistic assessment of harm scenarios | Could enable generation of violent content, potential for automated harmful content creation |

### 4. Defense Analysis (DA)

Components analyzing protective measures and remediation:

| Component | Description | Documentation Guidance | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| DA1: Existing Mitigations | Current protections against the vulnerability | Document any existing partial mitigations | Rate limiting provides partial protection, monitoring detects some variants |
| DA2: Recommended Mitigations | Suggested protective measures | Provide specific actionable recommendations | Implement conversation state monitoring, enhance persona consistency verification |
| DA3: Detection Methods | How to detect exploitation attempts | Document specific detection approaches | Pattern matching for authority persona markers, conversation flow analysis |
| DA4: Remediation Status | Current status of remediation efforts | Use standard remediation status codes | IN-DEVELOPMENT (estimated completion 2024-06-30) |
| DA5: Verification Approach | How to verify successful remediation | Document testing methodology for remediation verification | Systematic testing using 20 exploitation variants across diverse contexts |

### 5. Metadata Elements (ME)

Components providing context and management information:

| Component | Description | Documentation Guidance | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| ME1: Severity Ratings | Standardized severity assessments | Include multiple rating scores | AVRS: 65/100 (High), CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N |
| ME2: Related Vulnerabilities | Connections to other vulnerabilities | Reference related vulnerabilities | Related to VECTOR-20240217-0023, variant of CVE-2023-12345 |
| ME3: References | External information sources | List all pertinent references | Security advisory SA-2024-03, research paper DOI:10.xxxx/yyyy |
| ME4: Timeline | Key dates in vulnerability lifecycle | Document all significant dates | Discovery: 2024-04-01, Vendor notification: 2024-04-03, Patch release: Pending |
| ME5: Disclosure Status | Current disclosure information | Document disclosure state and plan | Limited disclosure to vendor, planned public disclosure 2024-07-15 |
